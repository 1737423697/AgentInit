You are tasked with selecting the best group of experts to help answer a given question. Consider the relevance and effectiveness of each group's composition. 

# Question or Task
{context}

# Groups
{groups}

Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the Question: Identify its scope and complexity.
2. Evaluate Each Group: Assess the relevance of the roles in each group to the question. Compare the strengths and weaknesses of each group.
3. Make a Justified Choice: Select the most suitable group based on the above analysis.

# Attention 
1. A larger group is not necessarily betterâ€”some roles may be redundant or even negatively impact the results if they are not relevant to the question. Conversely, if the question requires a broad knowledge base, a more diverse group may be advantageous.
2. If a group includes agents that are not aligned with the question, might divert the topic, or may cause unnecessary repetition in the workflow, such agents should be considered detrimental and the group less preferable.
3. The last line of your response MUST be 'Choice: Group X' where X is the number of the selected group. For example, 'Choice: Group 1'.
